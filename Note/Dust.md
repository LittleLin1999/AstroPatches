The origin of dust is still a debated topic (e.g. [Mattsson & Andersen 2012](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.423...38M/abstract), [Matsuura et al. 2015](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015ApJ...800...50M/abstract)), whether the bulk of dust grains have been produced by winds in **Asymptotic Giant Branch (AGB) stars, cooling-down SN ejecta, or growing in the ISM**. 

However, the presence of large amounts of iron in dust, as inferred from dust depletion, challenges the possibilities of AGB stars and SNe to be the main dust producers (e.g. [Dwek 2016](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2016ApJ...825..136D/abstract)). AGB stars seem very inefficient at producing iron-rich dust, but instead could produce iron-free silicates (e.g. [Norris et al. 2012](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012Natur.484..220N/abstract)). While far-infrared and submillimeter observations of SN 1987A have suggested that core-collapse SNe can produce significant amount of dust (0.4 – 0.7 M⊙, [Matsuura et al. 2011](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2011Sci...333.1258M/abstract)), only a fraction of this dust may survive the SN reverse shock (e.g. [Hirashita et al. 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017MNRAS.472.4587H/abstract)). In addition, no dust emission has been observed towards SNe Type Ia, where most Fe is produced.

Yet, ultraviolet and X-ray observations along many lines of sight in the ISM show that iron is severely depleted in the gas phase compared to expected solar abundances. The missing iron, comprising about 90% of the total, is believed to be locked up in interstellar dust. This suggests that **most of the missing iron must have precipitated from the ISM gas by cold accretion onto preexisting silicate, carbon, or composite grains**. Iron is thus the only element that requires most of its growth to occur outside the traditional stellar condensation sources. This is a robust statement that does not depend on our evolving understanding of the dust destruction efficiency in the ISM. Reconciling the physical, optical, and chemical properties of such composite grains with their many observational manifestations is a major challenge for understanding the nature and origin of interstellar dust.
