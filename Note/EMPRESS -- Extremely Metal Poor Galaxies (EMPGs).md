local EMPGs are widely thought to be useful for understanding how young galaxies form and evolve in the early universe, as living fossils in the universe today

#### Physical origins of local EMPG
- One is that EMPGs have episodic star-formation histories where metal-poor gas falling on metal-enriched galaxies trigger metal-poor star formation that appear to be EMPGs, which we refer to as an “episodic star-formation scenario” (e.g., Sanchez Almeida et al. 2014, 2015, 2016; McQuinn et al. 2020). 
- The other is that EMPGs are experiencing the onset of initial star formation with extremely metal-poor gas similar to the primordial gas, which we refer to as a “first star-formation scenario” (e.g., Recchi et al. 2001; Isobe et al. 2022a).
