## Post-starburst

Spectrum v.s. Age : Fig. 1 in https://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.06843.pdf

- A transition phase: a strong starburst followed by quenching in the recent past
- selected by their strong Balmer absorption lines and no or weak nebular emission lines such as H$\alpha$,  \[OII\]  and so on
	- The strong Balmer absorption lines are caused by a significant contribution from Atype stars, which indicates high star formation activities in the recent past 
	- no significant emission lines suggest little on-going star formation in the galaxy
- fraction of PSBs is relatively small in the entire galaxy population (1â€“2%)
- PSBs are expected to abruptly stop their star formation after starburst and therefore considered to be in a rapid transition phase from SFG to QG
