# CIV
- Typical galaxies show CIV in 
	- absorption from ISM
	- P Cygni profile from stellar winds of massive galaxies
- AGNs produce broad CIV emission in >100km/s
- Narrow CIV from high-redshift galaxies
- Pure CIV in emission: indicators of low-metallicity



# HeII
- Stellar HeII from stellar winds of Wolf-Rayet stars
	- broad in relation to wind velocities (Δv > 1000 km/s)
	- supported by strong detections of the N IV λ1488 and N V λ1720 WN W-R features.
	- Leitherer et al. (1999): the number of W-R stars relative to O stars peaks around $10^{6.6}$ yr.
	- prominent in binary models with stellar metallicities of $Z_*$ = 0.004 or 0.008
- Photoionization by AGNs:
	- diagnostics of the C IV/He II and C III]/He II line ratios
- photoionization budget: exotic Pop III stars?
	- A top- heavy IMF in extremely low metallicity regions can produce large He II line luminosities: Z<1e-5
	- H II regions with normal oxygen abundances can exhibit extreme UV features if they are powered by stars that are O/Fe enhanced relative to solar /  the ISM was enriched by core-collapse SNe
	- Kudritzki (2002): certain O stars are indeed hot enough to ionize He II / Brinchmann et al. (2008): at low metallicities nebular He II is predominantly produced by O stars where optically thin winds can be penetrated by ionizing photons. 
	- Gräfener & Vink (2015): metal-poor, very massive stars form strong but slow W-R-type stellar winds owing to their proximity to the Eddington limit. Post-AGB stars from an older stellar population may also produce He II emission.
- high-mass X-ray binaries
- gravitational cooling radiation from gas accretion
