- The three key parameters for the required ionization emissivity of reionization: $f_{\rm esc}$ , $\xi_{\rm ion}$ and the faint-end cutoff of LF $M_{\rm lim}$
- if galaxies drive the  reionization of the universe  , $\log_{10} f_{\rm esc, rel} \xi_{\rm ion}=24.5\pm 0.1$ assuming the clumping factor $C=3$.$$
\begin{gathered}
f_{\mathrm{esc}} \xi_{\text {ion }} f_{\text {corr }}\left(M_{\mathrm{lim}}\right)(C / 3)^{-0.3} \\
=10^{24.50 \pm 0.10} \mathrm{~Hz} \mathrm{erg} \mathrm{s}^{-1}
\end{gathered}
$$
- The  $\xi_{\rm ion}$-estimated $f_{\rm esc}$ is ~ 0.13 and 0.14

- Adopt an updated CMB electron scattering optical depth from Planck 2016
- Predict an average escape fraction of <5% throughout the bulk of the epoch of reionization if:
	- galaxies form stars down to the atomic cooling limit before reionization and a photosuppression mass of logMh ∼ 9 during/after reionization (−13 < MUV,lim < −11)
	- galaxies become more efficient producers of ionizing photons at higher redshifts and fainter magnitudes
	- there is a significant but subdominant contribution by AGNs at z>7
- The model predicts that the bulk of the ionizing photons coming from extremely faint galaxies (logMh<9) with globally averaged escape fractions of 6%–10%;   brighter galaxies (−20 < MUV < −16; log Mh > 9.5) have escape fractions of only 1%–3%.
- If the escape fraction is high (e.g. 9%), unsurprisingly, this model completes reionization earlier at z = 7.0 ± 0.8.
- Compared with Bouwens+15ab (10%-20%), this inferred emissivity increases with increasing redshift over 6 < z < 10, which is a consequence of the lower average escape fraction over this epoch

**Choustikov+2023**
- LyC photon leakage requires:
	- A strong burst of star formation such that a significant quantity of ionizing photons are produced.
	- Either a significant reduction in the neutral gas content of the ISM such that photons can leak relatively isotropically (density- bounded case) or a creation of ionized channels (ionization-bounded case). This is achieved through photoionization and mechanical feed-back.
	- A timescale synchronization such that stars continue producing significant amounts of LyC photons after feedback has disrupted the ISM.
- **Successful LyC escape diagnostics should be**
	- High sSFR so that significant numbers of ionizing photons are produced and feedback has a chance of disrupting the ISM
	- A stellar population age >3.5 Myr such that SN have had time to explode but <10 Myr so that the LyC production rate remains high.
	- A proxy for neutral gas content and the ionization state of the ISM to identify when feedback has efficiently coupled to gas in order to create ionized channels or disrupt/ionize the entire medium.
	- *Each of these conditions alone are insufficient to select a sample of only LyC leaking galaxies.*
- O32, $\Sigma_{SFR}$ , EW$(H\beta)$ or MUV alone is not a good diagnostics for LyC escape
	- O32 is necessary but insufficie: 
		- likely indicative of high sSFRs 
		- O32 peaks at ages < 3.5 Myr and  it preferentially traces objects that have yet to surpass the SN time scale. i.e. galaxies with dense, dusty ISMs with stellar populations that are too young to disrupt it
		- not an indicator of neutral ISM density and only marginally traces dust
	- $\Sigma_{sSFR}$ and $\Sigma_{SFR}$ 
		- may be biased towards galaxies with too young stellar ages
		- no relation between ΣSFR and the state of the ISM
	- EW$({H\beta})$
		- strong tracer of sSFR
		- the highest values of EW($H\beta$) trace ages < 3.5 Myr
		- no correlation between EW($H\beta$) and the state of the ISM 
	- MUV
		- LyC leakers tend to be lower mass, fainter galaxies? Some claimed yes while some works found there are no correlations between MUV and $f_{\rm esc}$
		- MUV is a weak indicator of sSFR
		- high MUV could also indicate ages < 3.5 Myr
		- no correlation betweenMUV and ISM state 
		- For a fixed stellar mass, high intrinsic MUV correlates with a high sSFR; observed MUV becomes a strong indicator of dust attenuation which represents one of the tracers on ISM state.
		- brighter galaxies at fixed stellar mass are biased towards having higher  $f_{\rm esc}$:  sample selection is key for the emergence of trends between  $f_{\rm esc}$ and various galaxy properties. 
- **E(B-V) and observed $\beta$ are the best tracers**, strongly satisfying 2/3 of the criterion
	- $\beta$
		- in order to have a steep slope, the young stellar population must outshine the older stellar populations in the galaxy
		- galaxies with the bluest $\beta$(i.e. < −2.5) are also very strongly biased towards having the highest sSFRs (high sSFR does not guarantee a blue $\beta$ and there exists strong scatter due to dust)
		- The UV slope is predicted to stay approximately constant for the first 10 Myr of evolution (Stanway et al. 2016).
		-  marginally satisfies the second criteria in that it picks out galaxies that can contribute to reionization (but expect some contamination from low $f_{\rm esc}$ galaxies with stellar ages younger than 3.5 Myr
		- the observed $\beta$ is strongly sensitive to dust
	- E(B-V)
		- SNe are able to destroy dust (in this case by destroying neutral hydrogen) through mechanical feedback: E(B − V) marginally satisfies the second criterion.  
		- dust tracks neutral hydrogen which has a much more important impact on $f_{\rm esc}$ (Katz et al. 2022b)
- multi-dimensional diagnostics with 6 observables
	- This work: bright LyA emitters tend to have LyC escape fractions < 10%
	- Agrees with Witten et al. (2023): z>6 bright LyA emitters have fesc < 10%
	- Contradicts with Naidu et al. (2022): bright LyA emitters with low peak velocity separation and line-centre flux all have escape fractions of 20%.  Matthee et al. (2022b) showed that if half of bright LyA emitters have an escape fraction of 50%, then one can match observational constraints on the neutral fraction evolution. 


**Maji+2022**
- There is a positive correlation between the escape fractions of Lyα and LyC radiations in the brightest LAEs, similar to that reported by recent observational studies. 
- However, when  including fainter LAEs, the correlation disappears, which suggests that the observed relation may be driven by selection effects. 
- brighter LAEs are dominant contributors to reionization, with $L^{Lyα}_{esc} > 10^{40} erg s^{−1}$ galaxies accounting for >90% of the total amount of LyC radiation escaping into the intergalactic medium in the simulation.
	- although faint LAEs are far more numerous, brighter LAEs as a group contribute more to the escaping ionizing luminosity.
