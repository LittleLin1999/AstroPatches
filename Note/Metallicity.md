## Ne
Neon is produced during the late stages of massive stellar evolution
- $^{20}$Ne is produced by carbon burning and is expected to closely track oxygen abundance; this correlation is confirmed by observations of extragalactic HII regions (Garnett 2002) and planetary nebulae (Henry 1989).
- one of the dominant ionization species in HII regions, serves as one of the principal coolants along with oxygen (Burbidge et al. 1963, Gould 1963).

tracers of the ionizing flux in star-forming galaxies
- high critical densities of \[NeII\] and \[NeIII\] make their fluxes insensitive to $n_e$ even in low-density HII regions and galaxies
- \[NeIII\]/\[NeII\] ratio is a very robust extinction- and abundance-insensitive indicator of the hardness of the radiation field surrounding massive young stars (see also Thornley et al. 2000, Perez-Montero et al. 2007, O’Halloran et al. 2006).
- The ionization thresholds of Ne+ and Ne++ are 575˚A (ionization potential of 21.56 eV) and 303˚A (ionization potential of 40.96 eV) respectively $\rightarrow$ ratio as a good direct tracer of the shape of the UV radiation field 
- The ionization thresholds of O+ and O++ are 911˚A (ionization potential of 13.62 eV) and 353˚A (ionization potential of 35.12 eV) respectively;
