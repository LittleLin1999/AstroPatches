## CANDELS
Near-infrared  WFC3 (UVIS/IR imaging) and optical ACS on HST
* UVIS: UV and optical: 200-1000 nm
* IR: 800-1700 nm
* ACS/WFC: Wide field CCD channel; multiple spectral elements from 3800  to 10,000 AA.
* aim: Cosmic dawn and Cosmic high noon

## Spitzer
* IRAC (Infrared Array Camera): 5.2×5.2 arcmin images at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8 microns; observe two fields with centers ~6.5 arcmin apart; One field is imaged at 3.6 and 5.8 microns while the other is imaged at 4.5 and 8.0 microns.
* IRAC Dark field: near the north ecliptic pole; 3x3 mosaic pattern (diameter=15 arcmin) ; deep image into the confusion limit (3.6 and 4.5µm peak at 186 hours and  5.8 and 8µm peak at ~60 hours.); ancillary data spanning the x-ray to far-infrared.

> *confusion noise*: an additional noise factor closely related to the astronomical background. The sensitivity cannot be improved by increasing the integration time after reaching the confusion limit.
> ➡️ fluctuations of the background sky brightness below which sources cannot be detected individually
> ➡️ from Structure of the CFIRB/intrinsically discrete extragalactic sources
