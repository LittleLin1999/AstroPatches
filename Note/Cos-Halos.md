- **Driver: halo missing baryon problem**
	- Baryon counting = star + cold ISM + hot X-ray gas; Galaxies and halos $\Omega_b/\Omega_m$ ratio $\ll$Cosmological ratio;  galaxy halos miss 60% baryons.
	- much of the CGM cannot be traced with X-ray and too diffuse to be detected directly currently.
	- Key: the total baryonic mass in  multiphase CGM traced $\rightarrow$ absorption from hydrogen and metal lines in various ionization states
- **Method/Results**
	- $U-HI$ anti-correlation: photoionized clouds in (or not far from) local hydrostatic equilibrium
		- $U = n_{\rm ion}/(n_{H}+n_p)$  
		- over dense absorbers = local Jeans length; $HI$ column density $\rightarrow$ $n_H$ volume density $\rightarrow$ $U\downarrow$ 
	- $U-R$ correlation: declining gas volume density with impact parameter
		- gas far from the host galaxy is highly ionized $\leftarrow$ low density outside $\leftarrow$ less shielded from EUVB
	- Mass measurement
		- lower limit of metal mass $\leftarrow$ integration of $\Sigma_{\rm gas}$ 
		- lower limit within $R_{\rm vir}$  $\leftarrow$ inner CGM 
		- $>$ 25% of the baryon budget of an $L\approx L_*$  halo is accounted for by cool, photoionized gas in the CGM
		- sum the conservatively estimated contributions from Disk+Cool CGM+WH CGM+Hot CGM $\rightarrow$ galaxies may not be baryon-depleted at all relative to the cosmological baryon fraction
	- gas volume densities in the context of simple hydrostatic one- and two-phase models
		- compare $n_e-R$ profile with models
		- single-phase model cannot reproduce the observation; the cool CGM profile of the two-phase model is two orders of magnitude higher
		- not in hydrostatic equilibrium with a hot gas phase at the virial temperature of the galaxy halo
		- other means to support the gas: turbulence? magnetic field? or short live?
- **Main claim**
	- solve the missing **halo baryon** problem: galaxies have anywhere between 45% and 100% of their baryons relative to the cosmological fraction.
