- **Driver: halo missing baryon problem** and also CGM physical condition
	- Baryon counting = star + cold ISM + hot X-ray gas; Galaxies and halos $\Omega_b/\Omega_m$ ratio $\ll$Cosmological ratio;  galaxy halos miss 60% baryons.
	- much of the CGM cannot be traced with X-ray and too diffuse to be detected directly currently.
	- Key: the total baryonic mass in  multiphase CGM $\rightarrow$ absorption from hydrogen and metal lines in various ionization states
- **Method/Results**
	- $U-HI$ anti-correlation: photoionized clouds in (or not far from) local hydrostatic equilibrium
		- $U = n_{\rm ion}/(n_{H}+n_p)$  
		- over dense absorbers = local Jeans length; $HI$ column density $\rightarrow$ $n_H$ volume density $\rightarrow$ $U\downarrow$ 
	- $U-R$ correlation: $n_{\rm gas}-R$ anti-correlation in nature
		- gas far from the host galaxy is highly ionized $\leftarrow$ low density outside $\leftarrow$ less shielded from EUVB
	- Mass measurement
		- lower limit of metal mass $\leftarrow$ integration of $\Sigma_{\rm gas}$ 
		- lower limit within $R_{\rm vir}$  $\leftarrow$ inner CGM 
		- $>$ 25% of the baryon budget of an $L\approx L_*$  halo is accounted for by cool, photoionized gas in the CGM
		- sum the conservatively estimated contributions from Disk+Cool CGM+WH CGM+Hot CGM $\rightarrow$ galaxies may not be baryon-depleted at all relative to the cosmological baryon fraction
	- gas volume densities in the context of simple hydrostatic one- and two-phase models
		- compare $n_e-R$ profile with models
		- single-phase model cannot reproduce the observation; the cool CGM profile of the two-phase model is two orders of magnitude higher
		- not in hydrostatic equilibrium with a hot gas phase at the virial temperature of the galaxy halo
		- other means to support the gas: turbulence? magnetic field? or short live?
- **Main claim**
	- solve the missing **halo baryon** problem: galaxies have anywhere between 45% and 100% of their baryons relative to the cosmological fraction.

- **Question to address:** the mechanism for the **highly ionized CGM** traced by O VI absorption lines
- **Method/Result**
	-  24 lines of sight probing the halos of low-redshift, $L\sim L_*$ star-forming galaxies at one-dimensional projected distances of 15–150 kpc
	- $R\sim 18,000 \rightarrow$  can measure the doppler paremeters $b$
	- Type
		- Broad type: low-ion matched O VI absorption with b > 40 km/s 
		- Narrrow type: low-ion matched O VI absorption with b < 35 km/s
		- No-low type: non-detection of low or intermediate ionization state gas within ∼50 km/s
	- $N_{\rm OVI}-b$ correlation v.s. Hackman+02 model for cooling, collisionally ionized gas
		- narrow: inconsistent with the radiative cooling correlation 
	- $N_{\rm OVI}-{\rm SFR/R^2}$  correlation
		- Broad type: strong correlation
			- driven primarily by the decrease in $N_{\rm OVI}$ with impact parameter 
			- could just as easily represent a gas surface density gradient in the galaxy halo.
		- Narrow and no-low type: no correlation
	- Ionic ratios $N_V/N_{OVI}$ 
		- no-low: suggest gas temperature of $T\approx T_{\rm vir}$  under the assumption of collisional ionization; trace halo gas cooling via collisions
		- broad: rule out most photoionization models; consistent with collisional ionization models
		- narrow: disfavor an origin in gas photoionized by the EUVB
- **main claim** 
	- no-low type:  tracing virialized halo gas
		- disappear for galaxies with $M_{\rm halo} > 10^{12}$ whose $T_{\rm vir}=10^{5.5} K$;   
		- collisionally ionized (based on $N_{\rm OVI}-b$)
		- collsional ionization $T=10^{5.5}K$ based on $N_{\rm NV}/N_{\rm OVI}$
		- cooling time scale
	- most of the total column of O VI may result from either gas photoionized primarily by *local* high-energy sources or gas radiatively cooling on large scales behind a multiphase, fast wind.

>Fielding+16 simulation:
>for galaxy with $M<M_{\rm crit}\approx 10^{11.5}$  halo gas far from hydrostatic equilibrium; 
>1. if the wind load heavy mass,wind shock cooling rapidly $\rightarrow$ a paucity of warm $>10^5K$ gas; CGM = dense, cold, outgoing clumps surrounded by relatively sparse inflowing cold gas
>2. winds with mass loading <1 $\rightarrow$ halo gas largely supported by turbulence and ram pressure from feedback; multiphase medium at $10^4\sim 10^5 K$ + dense gas flowing inwards along narrow channels
>
>for more massive galaxies, halo gas at $R_{\rm vir}$ is relatively insensitive to feedback model; At small radii, near the central galaxy, halo gas is regulated by feedback triggered by accretion of cold gas condensing out of the hotter ambient medium
>
>Oppenheimer+16 model: low-density, $\sim10^{5.5}$ mainly at 1–2 $R_{\rm vir}$ that has cooling times comparable to the Hubble time.

- **To explore:** metalicity in cool CGM ($T\sim 10^4 K$)
- **Method**
	- FUV spectra of 13 quasars
	- 14 HI Lyman limit CGM
	- metalicity assumed photoionization equilibrium
		- photoionization models parameterized by the gas density $n_H$,$N_{\rm HI}$, and metallicity \[Z/H\] against the observed ionic column densities of low ionization state metal species (e.g., Si+,Si++,N+)
		- MCMC
- **Result**
	- declining HI surface density with impact parameter $R_\perp$
	- increase in gas metallicity \[Z/H\] with declining $N_{\rm HI}$ (thus with $R_{\perp}$)
	- no evidence for a radial gradient in the gas metallicity
		- If anything, \[Z/H\] increases at higher impact parameters
			- very weak, follows from the strong correlations between NHI and R
		- If so, conflict with models that envision the modern CGM to be dominated by on-going winds from the central galaxy. 
		- may favor scenarios where the CGM was polluted by one or more processes long ago
			- CGM of bright z~2 galaxies also exhibits a high degree of enrichment
	- cool CGM gas mass
	- CGM escape fraction: transmission of ionizing radiation through gas
- **Main claim**
	- discovery: unexpected NHI relation with R and metalicity
	- galatic missing baryon problem
		- cool CGM mass + literature hot CGM mass =  cosmic fraction of baryons
		- have not yet identified the true proportion of halo gas in cool, warm, and hot phases
