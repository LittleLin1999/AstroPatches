## Trainor+2015
- Rest-frame UV spectral properties of faint LAEs/LBGs near hyper luminous quasars at z~2.7;

## Werk+2014
**halo missing baryon problem**
- Baryon counting = star + cold ISM + hot X-ray gas; Galaxies and halos Omega_b/Omega_m ratio << Cosmological ratio;  galaxy halos miss 60% baryons.
- much of the CGM cannot be traced with X-ray and too diffuse to be detected directly currently.
