# OVI emission
#kickin 

* WHIM: 1e5-1e6 K
* shock heating/outflow / pressure
* low-z absorbers/ OVI emission halos have been detected
* require high SFR
---

1. High-z OVI diffuse emission ?
High Temperature for the environment
Starburst galaxy/ quasar outflow/ stacking of star-forming galaxy

2. If metallicity emission is related to LAE/LBG
Relation between OVI/CIV…  emission and Lyman alpha REW or luminosity or halo fraction…

3. Missing metallicity problem at high-z
