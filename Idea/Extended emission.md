# OVI emission：JWST/MUSE
#kickin 

* WHIM: 1e5-1e6 K
* shock heating/outflow / pressure
* low-z absorbers/ OVI emission halos have been detected
* require high SFR
---

1. High-z OVI diffuse emission ?
High Temperature for the environment
Starburst galaxy/ quasar outflow/ stacking of star-forming galaxy

2. If metallicity emission is related to LAE/LBG
Relation between OVI/CIV…  emission and Lyman alpha REW or luminosity or halo fraction…

3. Missing metallicity problem at high-z

# O\[III\]$\lambda\lambda5007$ emission: JWST
- ionized gas
- star-forming galaxies / nearby AGN / line region
- CGM?  star formation？

extended OIII emission could be detected using JWST

# extended Lya nebulae: Merian/MUSE
- blind searching for extended lya nebulae
- expected around faint continnuum + high-redshift sources
