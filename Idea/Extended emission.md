# OVI emission：JWST/MUSE
#kickin 

* WHIM: 1e5-1e6 K
* shock heating/outflow / pressure
* low-z absorbers/ OVI emission halos have been detected
* require high SFR
---

1. High-z OVI diffuse emission ?
High Temperature for the environment
Starburst galaxy/ quasar outflow/ stacking of star-forming galaxy

2. If metallicity emission is related to LAE/LBG
Relation between OVI/CIV…  emission and Lyman alpha REW or luminosity or halo fraction…

3. Missing metallicity problem at high-z

# O\[III\]$\lambda\lambda5007$ emission: JWST
- ionized gas
- star-forming galaxies / nearby AGN / line region
- CGM?  star formation？
- **Hanny's Voorwerp**: OIII emitting gas without galaxies outside an ellipitical galaxies, which is quenched long before; the first assumption is that the gas is luminated by the AGN when it's active, and then continuuously emitting OIII even after the galaxies is quenched.

extended OIII emission could be detected using JWST

# extended Lya nebulae: Merian/MUSE
- blind searching for extended lya nebulae
- expected around faint continnuum + high-redshift sources
