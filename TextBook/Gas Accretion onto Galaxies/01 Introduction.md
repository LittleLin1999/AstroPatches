# 01 Introduction
## 1.1 introduction
- **Gas accretion is needed**
	- star formation rate at all redshifts $\Rightarrow$ run out of fuel within a few Gyrs without replenishment.
	- Metalicity of stars
	- the decrease in the mass density of cold hydrogen $\rho_{H}$ with time does not closely track the steady increase in the mass density of stars $\rho_*$ $\Rightarrow$ ionized IGM to cool and accrete onto galaxies

## 1.2  the need for accretion through cosmic time
- **gas depletion time**
	- $t_{dep}<1$ Gyr at $z>1$; $t_{dep}\sim$ a few Gyr at lower redshifts
	- Primary Exception: gas-rich dwarf galaxies $t_{dep}\sim t_{H}$
	- At higher redshift: more efﬁcient mode of star formation / the shorter depletion times / a greater rate of accretion 
		- speciﬁc star formation rate gradually decreases towards lower redshifts
- **Cold gas content**: cooling of the ionized gas in the IGM and halos
	- $\rho_{\rm HI}$ v.s. $\rho_{*}$ : the evolution of the HI does not appear to closely follow the evolution of the stellar mass density or star formation rate density $\Rightarrow$ accretion + cooling of new HI
	- The molecular gas depletion rate, e.g. CO
- **Metalicity distribution of stars in galaxies**
	- metallicity distribution of the long-lived stars $\Rightarrow$ supports galaxy evolution models with a continuous inﬂow of relatively low metallicity gas
	- G-dwarf problem: closed box galaxy evolution model leads to a wider distribution of stellar metalicities than is observed
	- the accreting gas needs to be relatively low metallicity $\Rightarrow$  IGM being a major source of accretion.

## 1.3 Expected modes of accretion
The major sources of the accreting material : IGM, satellites, and recycled feedback gas
