# 01 Introduction
## 1.1 introduction
- **Gas accretion is needed**
	- star formation rate at all redshifts $\Rightarrow$ run out of fuel within a few Gyrs without replenishment.
	- Metalicity of stars
	- the decrease in the mass density of cold hydrogen $\rho_{H}$ with time does not closely track the steady increase in the mass density of stars $\rho_*$ $\Rightarrow$ ionized IGM to cool and accrete onto galaxies

## 1.2  the need for accretion through cosmic time
- **gas depletion time**
	- $t_{dep}<1$ Gyr at $z>1$; $t_{dep}\sim$ a few Gyr at lower redshifts
	- Primary Exception: gas-rich dwarf galaxies $t_{dep}\sim t_{H}$
	- At higher redshift: more efﬁcient mode of star formation / the shorter depletion times / a greater rate of accretion 
		- speciﬁc star formation rate gradually decreases towards lower redshifts
- **Cold gas content**: cooling of the ionized gas in the IGM and halos
	- $\rho_{\rm HI}$ v.s. $\rho_{*}$ : the evolution of the HI does not appear to closely follow the evolution of the stellar mass density or star formation rate density $\Rightarrow$ accretion + cooling of new HI
	- The molecular gas depletion rate, e.g. CO
- **Metalicity distribution of stars in galaxies**
	- metallicity distribution of the long-lived stars $\Rightarrow$ supports galaxy evolution models with a continuous inﬂow of relatively low metallicity gas
	- G-dwarf problem: closed box galaxy evolution model leads to a wider distribution of stellar metalicities than is observed
	- the accreting gas needs to be relatively low metallicity $\Rightarrow$  IGM being a major source of accretion.
	- metalicity of planetary nebula: i.e. metalicity of its progenitor stars

## 1.3 Expected modes of accretion
The major sources of the accreting material : IGM, satellites, and recycled feedback gas

**IGM**
the expected largest source;
Accretion from the IGM along ﬁlaments where the outer parts are heated and the inner parts are able to cool. The hot IGM-originated halo gas cools near the disk as it mixes with denser gas.

Simulation: the ﬁlaments of low metallicity IGM are partially heated as they move through the halo $\rightarrow$ cool in the central regions as they approach the disk

**satellite gas**
Satellites are stripped of their gas as they move through the diffuse halo medium and this gas will fall to the disk as warm clouds. As the gas slows and mixes with denser feedback material it can potentially re-cool close to the disk.

- Direct evidence: satellite gas is stripped within a galaxy halo; satellites closer to galaxies typically do not have gas and are redder
- Dominant stripping mechanism: Ram pressure stripping by the CGM of the host galaxy; heated  (not clear that how the gas cools)

**Feedback**
Feedback material can accrete as part of a fountain ﬂow close to the disk with hot gas from stellar feedback rising and then cooling and falling back down. Gas from a central outﬂow will mix with existing halo density enhancements and this may also result in cool clumps that eventually accrete.

- kinematic signatures: feedback mechanisms putting gas into the halos of galaxies
- a large mass of metals detected in galaxy halos that remains bound $\Rightarrow$abundant future star formation fuel that has already cycled through the galaxy
- the metallicities of the stars in galaxies indicate feedback should not dominate as the fuel source

## 1.4 Direct Observational Evidence for Accretion

**The Milky Way**
- gas at 1–15 kpc above the disk is clearly infalling
- An extended, diffuse halo medium is inferred to exist for the Milky Way from the nature of the Magellanic System and stripped satellites

**Gas accretion beyond the Milky Way**
- Zheng 2017: UV-bright stars in M33’s disk as background probes and found the kinematic signature of inﬂow across the star-forming disk in the Si IV absorption lines $\Rightarrow$ an accreting layer of gas at the disk-halo interface
	- The accretion rate obtained (2.9 M_sun/yr ; M_M33=5$\times10^{10}$ M_sun) is relatively large for this small galaxy, and may be further evidence for the infall of fuel being intermittent in nature.

**Method**
- absorption line experiments that use distant background probes and model the likely location of the gas relative to the galaxy
- particularly low metallicity gas in a galaxy halo $\Rightarrow$ it is often claimed to be the accretion of the IGM ﬁlaments (may or may not?)
- Filamentary extensions of Lyman-alpha emission at high redshift / extensions of  HI emission at low redshift (the origin of the gas and the direction the gas ?)
