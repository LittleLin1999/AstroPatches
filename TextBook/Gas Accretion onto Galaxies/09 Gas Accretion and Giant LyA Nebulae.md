# 09 Giant Lya Nebulae
## 9.2 Observations of Giant Lya Nebulae
- **Pilot**
	- Djorgovski+1985: Lick 3m telescope, radio-loud quasar + companion LyA emitting galaxies (narrow-line AGN) about 5 arcsec from it
	- Hu&Cowie 1987: bridge of LyA emission between quasar and the companion galaxy
- **Initial attempt**
	- *possible link between radio and LyA emission?*
		- Before 1990s: search for Lya emission around radio-quiet quasars but no detectable Lya candidates 
		- In early 1990s: around radio-loud quasars+almost 100% detection rate; large LyA Nebulae around non-QSO radio-sources
	-  *companion LyA emission was not restricted to radio loud quasars only !*
		- First detection of Lya emission companion to radio quiet quasar: Steidel+1991
		- Bremer+1992: extended (~5 arcsec) emission in long-slit spectra of two radio-quiet quasars at z ~3.6.
- **Quasar Giant Nebulae**
	- Slug Nebula: radio-quiet quasar; 55 arcsec (~460kpc);  beyond the viral halo of the quasar; high SB; 
	- Jackpot Nebula: a physically associated quasar quartet and a large overdensity of LyA emitting galaxies $\Rightarrow$ possibly a proto-cluster
	- QSO Museum (Borisova+16): 17 radio quiet quasars and 2 radio loud; 100% detection; 

>*the difference with the detection rate of NB surveys at z ~2 cannot be completely and easily explained by observational limitations*

**Radio-galaxy Lya halos**
HzRG: High-z Radio Galaxies; often show extended radio lobes that have been associated with bi-polar jets;

ubiquitous detection of extended Lya emission around HzRG extending in several cases above 100 kpc in size
- apparent alignment between Lya emission and the radio jet axis
- broad kinematics
- associated extended C IV and He II emission
-  invariable association with large overdensity as traced by companion Lya galaxies
- their UV line ratios and kinematics seem to be quite distinct from the radio-quiet quasar Nebulae

**Lya Blobs**

an extended LyA emission over scales signiﬁcantly larger than a single galaxy that does not seem to contain an AGN (at the time of their discovery)

Giant LABs with sizes above 100 kpc are mainly discovered by targeting known overdense regions or bright infrared and submillimeter galaxies

- **Steidel 2000**
	- two very luminous, very extended regions of line emission which we descriptively call ‘blobs’; with similar extent and luminosities to radio-loud quasar and radio-galaxy Nebulae; but apparently **lacking any associated, bright continuum or radio source**.
	- exceed the “giant LyA Nebula” size of 100 kpc
	- LAB1: a strong submillimeter source + but no evidence from deep Chandra X-ray observations of a clear X-ray counterpart $\Rightarrow$ but did not exclude the possibility of a luminous AGN but heavily obscured;  LAB2: a fainter submillimeter source + clear evidences for hard X-ray emission;
- LAB searching e.g., around luminous infrared sources
	- associated with Type 2 AGN
	- narrow and centrally concentrated C IV and He II emission
	- relatively narrow LyA emission in velocity space and possibly a ordered velocity shear $\Rightarrow$ this is compatible with other nebulae associated with radio-quiet AGN.

## 9.3 Origin of the emission
“cool” gas (i.e., with temperatures well below 1E5K)

(1) recombination radiation following hydrogen photoionization (by a quasar or star forming galaxy) 
(2) “continuum-pumping” or Lya scattering of the photons produced in the quasar broad-line-region or within the Interstellar Medium (ISM) of a star forming galaxy;
(3) Lya collisional excitation and recombination radiation following collisional ionization (the socalled Lya cooling radiation).

#### **Recombination Radiation**
hydrogen recombination rate has a relatively **mild dependence from temperature**, i.e., about linear around 1E4K

Case B: every Lyman-line photon from n > 2 levels is converted into lower series photons plus either Lya or two-photon continuum; the fraction of Lya photons for each recombination event ranges between 0.68 and 0.61 for 4 < logT < 4.7

- recombination radiation is a viable scenario to explain the observed Lya luminosities and SB 
	- dense (n > 1 $cm^{-3}, \sim 1-100$ )
	- highly ionized: need $Q_{\rm ion}\sim 10^{54}–10^{56} s^{-1} \Rightarrow$ AGN, even with modest luminosities, or by starbursts with star formation rates of at least $10^2-10^3 M_\odot/{\rm yr}$.
	- cold (T~$10^4$K ) 
	- clumps with volume ﬁlling factors smaller than $10^{-3}$ / the gas clumping factor >1000 on projected scales with size of about 5–8 kpc.

#### **scattering**
originate from the ISM of embedded galaxies or from the broad line region of the associated AGN, rather than being produced “in situ” by recombination processes

- **polarization**: scattering from a central source is able to produce a larger and steeper polarization proﬁle with respect to scattering by photons produced by “in situ” processes
- **optical depth**: Assuming that most of the scatterings are produced at line center, then a continuum photon produced by the AGN is only scattered into Lya at distances larger than 100 kpc from the source, even for large clump densities.
	- most of the emission is concentrated in the inner parts $\Rightarrow$ scattering contribution in the case the gas is illuminated by the ionizing radiation of a source should be therefore negligible
- **If scattering dominate**
	- the central source is not highly ionizing the gas; still produce copious  Lya and continuum photons slightly blueward of Lya
	- the gas mostly neutral; the optical depths very large
	- photons initially *resonantly trapped in the inner regions*
		- the column densities need to be large enough to produce scattering in the wings of the line, i.e., log NHI > 21, resulting in much larger column densities and masses of neutral gas with respect to what observed in absorption around quasars

#### **Collisional Excitation**
- collisional excitation rates are a very strong function of temperature
	- only efﬁcient to produce Lya photons in a **partially ionized** medium only for **electron temperatures around 2–5 $\times 10^4$K .**
- Heating
	- cooling will quickly reduce the electron temperature effectively suppressing further Lya emission
	- if heating brings electron temperatures close to 1E5K, Lya collisional excitation would be suppressed again;
	- when lacking ionization source: heating by the gravitational potential energy due to cosmological accretion of gas into massive dark matter halos?
		- order of magnitude estimate for the potential energy is interestingly close to the observed Lya emission.
		- BUT: a signiﬁcant fraction of this potential energy should result in the formation of a hot gaseous halo with temperatures of the order of T ~ $10^7$ K as a result of the virial shocks
		- more effective cooling channel: free-free continuum when T large / line emission from HeII or metal line when T small
		- efﬁciency factor: how much of the potential energy is dissipated by this cold gas phase and required that this efﬁciency factor is at least few tens of percent in order to obtain enough Lya photons

>sources of ionization do exist within all nebulae observed to date: a pure Lya cooling origin of the nebulae is not necessarily required by the majority of the observations

the possible contribution of collisional Lya emission to recombination radiation as this would have important consequences on the estimates of densities and masses of the nebulae.

## 9.4 Origin of the Emitting Gas, Kinematics, and Gas Flows

**Origins**
(1) cosmological accretion from the IGM, 
(2) outﬂowing material from galaxy and AGN feedback, 
(3) in-situ formation from hot gas condensation.

**fate**
(1) accretion or “recycling” into galaxies (inﬂow) or into gaseous disks (rotation), 
(2) expulsion from the galaxy halos towards the IGM, 
(3) disruption and thermalization into the hot halo gas.

- **Radio loud nebulae**
	- FWHM 1000-1500km/s for radio loud nebulae
		- interpreted preferentially as being associated with powerful outﬂows from these AGN as a result of the jet-gas interaction
		- Or caused by gravitational motion in very massive halos
	- some show kinematically quiet halos
		- velocity shifts of hundred km/s $\Rightarrow$ rotating disks / gas infall
		- the more redshifted side of the nebula's Lya/ radio flux is more brighter $\Rightarrow$ closer to the observer $\Rightarrow$ infall towards the galaxies
	- HzRG: metal-rich, dusty abd dense outﬂows.
- **Radio quiet**
	- FWHM $\sim 300-500$km/s
	- coherent velocity shears in Lya and non-resonant $\Rightarrow$ in situ by recombination radiation + settled in a rotating disk / at least partially stable against collapse
	- Yang+2014: no signiﬁcant evidences for bulk motions

>kinematics in radio-loud nebulae: may be dominated by ionized outﬂows of relatively cold and metal-enriched material within at least the inner 30–50 kpc from the AGN; 
>
>while, on average, the ionized and clumpy gas in radio-quiet nebulae may be in a more “stationary” situation and in some cases settled in a possibly rotating structure. 
>
>accretion signatures could be “washed-out” by Lya radiative transfer effects or too small to be detected with current facilities because of their magnitude and possible projection effects
