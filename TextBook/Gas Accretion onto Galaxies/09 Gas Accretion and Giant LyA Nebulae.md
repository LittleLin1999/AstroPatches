# 09 Giant Lya Nebulae
## 9.2 Observations of Giant Lya Nebulae
- **Pilot**
	- Djorgovski+1985: Lick 3m telescope, radio-loud quasar + companion LyA emitting galaxies (narrow-line AGN) about 5 arcsec from it
	- Hu&Cowie 1987: bridge of LyA emission between quasar and the companion galaxy
- **Initial attempt**
	- *possible link between radio and LyA emission?*
		- Before 1990s: search for Lya emission around radio-quiet quasars but no detectable Lya candidates 
		- In early 1990s: around radio-loud quasars+almost 100% detection rate; large LyA Nebulae around non-QSO radio-sources
	-  *companion LyA emission was not restricted to radio loud quasars only !*
		- First detection of Lya emission companion to radio quiet quasar: Steidel+1991
		- Bremer+1992: extended (~5 arcsec) emission in long-slit spectra of two radio-quiet quasars at z ~3.6.
- **Quasar Giant Nebulae**
	- Slug Nebula: radio-quiet quasar; 55 arcsec (~460kpc);  beyond the viral halo of the quasar; high SB; 
	- Jackpot Nebula: a physically associated quasar quartet and a large overdensity of LyA emitting galaxies $\Rightarrow$ possibly a proto-cluster
	- QSO Museum (Borisova+16): 17 radio quiet quasars and 2 radio loud; 100% detection; 

>*the difference with the detection rate of NB surveys at z ~2 cannot be completely and easily explained by observational limitations*

**Radio-galaxy Lya halos**
HzRG: High-z Radio Galaxies; often show extended radio lobes that have been associated with bi-polar jets;

ubiquitous detection of extended Lya emission around HzRG extending in several cases above 100 kpc in size
- apparent alignment between Ly˛ emission and the radio jet axis
- broad kinematics
- associated extended C IV and He II emission
-  invariable association with large overdensity as traced by companion Lya galaxies
- their UV line ratios and kinematics seem to be quite distinct from the radio-quiet quasar Nebulae

**Lya Blobs**
Steidel 2000: two very luminous, very extended regions of line emission which we descriptively call ‘blobs’; with similar extent and luminosities to radio-loud quasar and radio-galaxy Nebulae; but apparently **lacking any associated, bright continuum or radio source**.
