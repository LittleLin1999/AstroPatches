# 04 Gas Accretion and Star Formation Rate

### 4.1 Key Parameters
the gas depletion time-scale / the mass loading factor / the returned mass fraction

### 4.3 Evidence for a Relationship Between the SFR and the Gas Infall Rate

#### 4.3.1
- **The Gas-Consumption Time-Scale**
	- If no gas supply is provided, the SF shuts off exponentially with a time-scale of ~0.75 Gyr. Since the SF has been active for much longer, a supply of external gas must have been feeding the SF process in all galaxies.

#### 4.3.2
- **Relationship Between Stellar Mass, SFR, and Gas Metallicity**
	- FMR: galaxies with higher SFR show lower metallicity at a given stellar mass
	- Explanation
		- the stochastic feeding of the SF process with external metal-poor gas: The advent of external gas does not change $M_*$ , but it decreases the mean metallicity of the star-forming gas while simultaneously triggering SF. As time goes on, the SF consumes gas and increases its metallicity, until new metal-poor gas arrives and the cycle re-starts.
	- Concensus despite controversial: (1) FMR is not an artifact (2) Metallicities decrease with increasing redshift (3) FMR is produced by metal-poor gas accretion triggering SF.
	- **Observation of FMR**
		- The FMR disappears when using single H II regions rather than galaxy integrated parameters (Sánchez et al. 2013).
		- The evolution of the FMR previously reported in the literature may be an artifact introduced by the use of the different metallicity indicators at different redshifts (Cullen et al. 2014).
		- a more fundamental FMR where the SFR is replaced with the gas mass (Bothwell et al. 2013)
		- galaxies with high SFR tend to show ﬂatter gradient (Stott et al. 2014)
	- **Interpretations of the FMR**
		- Lily+13: the gas reservoir available to form stars is allowed to change in time
		- Gronnow+15: Mergers
		- .....

#### 4.3.3
- **Relationship Between Lopsidedness and Metallicity**
	- **XMP**: The extremely metal-poor (XMP) galaxies of the local universe turn out to show a particular morphology consisting of a bright head and a faint tail.
	- The tadpole morphology is not unusual at high redshift, where galaxies tend to be clumpy and elongated
	- **morphologymetallicity relation**: at a ﬁxed mass, the more metal-poor galaxies turn out to be more lopsided
	- **gas accretion triggering scenario**: The accreted gas is metal-poor, and it induces off-center giant starforming clumps that gradually migrate toward the disk centers
		- clumps in-situ: the accreted gas builds up the gas reservoir in the disk to a point where disk instabilities set in and trigger SF.
		- clumps ex-situ: already formed clumps are incorporated into the disk
		- a signiﬁcant part of the SF in the disks occurs in these giant clumps; the gas accretion produces bright off-center starbursts increasing the lopsidedness of the host disk
		- the same trend can also be reproduced by gas-rich metalpoor mergers
	- dwarfs with active SF have more asymmetric outer HI envelopes than typical irregulars. Moreover, galaxies hosting an old burst (>100 Myr) have more symmetric H I morphology than those with a young one (<100 Myr).

#### 4.3.4
- **Metallicity Drops in Starbursts of Local Star-Forming Galaxies**
	- A drop in metallicity occurs in regions of intense SF
	- The existence of localized metallicity drops suggests a recent metal-poor gas accretion episode, ~ a few hundred Myr

#### 4.3.5
- **The Traditional G-dwarf Problem**
	- If a system of pure metal-poor gas evolves as a closed box, each new generation of stars must be less numerous and more metal-rich than the previous one... However, a deﬁcit of sub-solar metallicity G dwarf stars!
	- Explanation: the SF maintained by constant metal-poor gas accretion reaches a constant value set only by the stellar yield, which implies a value around the solar metallicity.

#### 4.3.6
- **Existence of a Minimum Metallicity for the Star-Forming Gas**
	- **Existence of a minimum metallicity in the CGM of galaxies at the level of 1% times the solar metallicity.**
	- **XMPs** : galaxies where the gas that produces stars has a metallicity smaller than 10% of the solar metallicity.
	- A sharp cut-off at low metallicity: no galaxy with 12 + log(O/H) < 7.0
	- Self-enrichment of the HII region? Eliminated! 
		- The timescale for the SN ejecta to cool down and mix is of the order of several hundred Myr and, thus, longer than the age of the H II regions
	- Pre-enrichment of the proto-galactic clouds: unclear why there should be a minimum metallicity for such clouds, except perhaps the value set by the metal contamination produced by Pop III stars; but the expected level of metal enrichment from PopIII star is of the order of $10^{-4}$ times the solar metallicity.
	- **QSO absorption**: the distribution of metallicity of Ly˛ absorbing clouds around galaxies with redshift up to 1
		- The distribution of metallicity turns out to be bimodal with typical values around 2.5% solar and 50% solar. 
		- The high-metallicity branch is expected to represent galaxy outﬂows, whereas the low-metallicity branch corresponds to inﬂows.
	- **HI gas around XMPs**: XMPs happen to be extremely gasrich, with gas fractions typically in excess of 10

#### 4.3.7
- **Origin of $\alpha$-enhanced Gas Forming Stars in Local Galaxies**
	- The gas forming stars in some of the local dwarf galaxies has elemental abundances which do not scale with the solar abundances.
	- The star-forming gas often shows logN/O~-1.5, much smaller than the solar value
	- **Explanation**: Stars and gas with $\alpha$-enhanced composition are expected to be formed from the ejecta of young stellar populations, so that low-mass stars have not had the time to explode as SN, and so, elements like Fe are underrepresented compared to the solar composition.
	- $\alpha$-enhanced gas forming stars at high-redshifts: the unusually high excitation of the gas forming stars in galaxies at redshift around 2 is due to their extreme $\alpha$-enhanced composition, with O/Fe~5 times the solar ratio.

#### 4.3.9
- **Direct Measurement of Inﬂows in Star-Forming Galaxies**
	- gas inflow in absorption againt steller spectra: probably associated with metal-rich gas returning to the galaxy after being ejected by a starburst or an AGN
	- Fathivavsari et al. (2016): infall in DLAs eclipsing QSOs. Metallicities are relatively low, and most of them have redshifts larger than that of their background QSO -> they could be associated with some low metallicity infalling material accreting onto the QSO host galaxies.
	- Kacprzak et al. (2012, 2015): absorption preferentially occurs along the directions pointed out by the minor and the major axes of the central galaxy. Absorbers aligned with the major axis are expected to show gas inﬂows, with the absorbers in the direction of the minor axis corresponding to gas outﬂows.
	- bimodal metallicity distribution of LLS: one peak at low metallicity and the other at high metallicity (Lehner et al. 2013) -> produced by metal-poor inﬂows and metal-rich outﬂows.

#### 4.4
- **The CGM and the Galactic Fountain**
	- The mixing with metal-rich gas from SF processes speeds up the cooling of the hot metal-poor CGM, and the fountain also returns gas that was never ejected
	- The majority of the metal-poor DLAs are far from the central galaxy (>20 kpc) and result from the cold gas streams from the IGM. In the migration inwards to the galaxy, they mix up with high-metallicity gas from stellar outﬂows, removing themselves from the metal-poor category.
	- Most of the gas used to produce stars at any time is pristine. It was never pre-processed by a star. Recycled stellar ejecta account for only 35% of the SFR and 20% of the stellar mass. The contribution was even less important in the past.
