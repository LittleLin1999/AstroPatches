# Report of the panel on galaxies

**picture of the baryons**: a predictive formulation of the assembly histories of galaxies and their dark matter halos, together with the evolution of their stellar populations, black holes, physical structures, chemical content, and circumgalactic, intracluster and intergalactic media.

“what, when, and where” of the regulatory mechanisms of galaxies

-  **D-Q1: REIONIZATION**
	- (a) Detailed Thermal History of the Intergalactic Medium and the Topology of Reionization
		- the dominant sources of ionizing photons during the epoch of reionization
		- the timeline, thermal history, and topology of reionization (21cm mapping)
		- ionized patches during the reionization epoch (quasar vicinity)
	- (b) Production of Ionizing Photons and Their Escape into the Intergalactic Medium
		- the number of low-mass galaxies (low-mass-end UV galaxies; proto-GC regime)
		- LyC escape  (internal properties of LyC leakers: gas kinematics, gas conditions, geometries, and chemical compositions of the sources, as well as maps of gas inflows and outflows)
	- (c) First star, galaxy and BH
		- popIII (lensing / Local Group / pair-instability supernovae / GRBs)
- **D-Q2: HOW DO GAS, METALS, AND DUST FLOW INTO, THROUGH, AND OUT OF GALAXIES**
	- (a) Gas fuel for star formation
		- baryonic accretion (IFU of diffuse ionized gas and neutral atomic/molecular gas in halos; track accretion from halo to disk based on the gas kinematics)
		- gas transformation into stars (cold molecular gas at sub-kpc and kinematics of molecular gas clumps at ~1e8Msun)
	- (b) Production, distribution and cycling of metals
		- how heavy elements are dispersed, ejected, mixed, and redistributed during the lifetime of a galaxy: heavy element production in stars / release to ISM / escape to CGM and IGM ( metallicity of HII region; absorption in qso sightlines; mapping diffuse line emission)
	- (c) The Coupling of Small-Scale Feedback to the Larger Gaseous Reservoir
		- feedback from stellar winds / supernovae / SMBH reduce star formation efficiency: energy and momentum injection processes 
		- when and how the large-scale environment can become hostile to accretion and/or cooling of gas onto a galaxy: formation and survival of dust and molecules 
		- gas kinematics and chemical imprints from the ISM to the CGM/ICM/IGM and connect small-scale feedback to gas properties on scales out to and beyond the virial radius (Spatially resolved observations on ionized gas, cold neutral and molecular ISM / resolving HII region scales / optical spectral maps of the CGM)
	- (d) CGM
		- baryonic flows (kinematic)
		- multiphase nature of the diffuse CGM/ICM and its complex dynamics: density, ionization, metallicity, and velocity field (full spectral range / mapping diffuse emission / resolving dense clumps)
- **DQ4: Histories of galaxies and DM halos**
	- (c) Connecting Local Galaxies to High-Redshift Galaxies
		- Production of LyC photons in young, massive and supermassive (Ms>1e4Msun) star clusters
		- Calibrating abundance measurements with UV nebular lines: abundances and depletion patterns of key elements in the neutral gas and in the photospheres of stars across the full range of metal abundances in nearby galaxies.
		- Quantifying the SFR of high-redshift, dusty galaxies requires use of infrared tracers
	- (d) Structure growth
		- Evolution of Morphologies, Gas Content, Kinematics, and Chemical Properties 
		- how galaxies transition from disordered kinematical and morphological states to more ordered systems (detailed kinematic and metal abundance maps at higher redshifts and lower masses; the star formation in the dusty progenitors of today’s massive galaxies)
  - **DISCOVERY AREA: MAPPING THE CIRCUMGALACTIC MEDIUM AND THE INTERGALACTIC MEDIUM IN EMISSION**
	  - baryon and metal accounting in different gas phases at different redshifts
	  - how galaxies acquire fuel for sustaining star formation 
	  - high-fidelity image of how energy and momentum from stars and SMBHs are transferred to the low-density CGM/IGM as a function of time

*Summary by Xiaojing*
Important questions are basically: 
- quantifying the reionization / reaching the earliest Universe
- Build-up of galaxies across the cosmic time 
- baryon cycling from small scale to large scale (neutral/ionized/Hydrogen/metal/dust) during the lifetime of a galaxy
Promising probes are basically:
- **spatially resolved** observations on **multi-phase gas, kinematics** and internal properties of galaxies (e.g. **metal abundance**) 
- from the large scale, diffuse CGM/IGM into *HII region scales*
