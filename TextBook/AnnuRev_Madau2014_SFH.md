# Cosmic Star-Formation History
Piero Madau and Mark Dickinson

- Tracers for star-formation
	- **UV-continuum emission**: the oldest galaxies is dominated by short-lived massive stars -> instantaneous star-formation rate density (SFRD).
	- **rest-frame NIR**: near-solar-mass-evolved stars that make up the bulk of a galaxy’s stellar mass-> the total global stellar mass density
	- **FIR emission of dusty starburst galaxies**:	Interstellar dust preferentially absorbs UV light and reradiates it in the thermal IR -> young stellar populations and the SFRD
- Star-Formation Rates
	- **UV light**: At young ages, the luminosity is dominated by UV emission from massive stars (low-mass stars dominate the mass integrated over the whole stellar population).  
		- 1500AA
			- Massive stars have short lifetimes, so the UV emission fades quickly.
			- For a galaxy forming stars at a constant rate, the 1,500-A luminosity stabilizes once O stars start to evolve off the main sequence.
			- For solar metallicity, by an age of $10^{7.5}$ years, the 1,500-A luminosity has reached 75% of its asymptotic value. The UV spectral slope reddens moderately with time, as the 1,500-A luminosity reaches a steady-state level
		- Mid-UV: 2300A / 2800A
			- from longer-lived, lower-mass stars, particularly at later ages, and the time evolution of the luminosity is more gradual.
			- longer-lived (B and A) stars continue to build up and contribute to the 2,800-A luminosity with time. 
		- Generally speaking, less-metal-rich stars produce more UV light.
		- expect signiﬁcant evolution in the L FUV to the SFR conversion factor as the global metallicity of galaxies evolves.
		- Drawback
			- the obscuring effect of dust
			- must either correct for the effects of dust absorption or measure the absorbed energy directly through IR emission
	- **IR**
		- The total IR luminosity (integrated over the wavelength range 8–1,000 μm) is a measurement of the energy that was absorbed by dust mainly at UV wavelengths
		- directly proportional to the absorbed fraction of the energy from star formation
		- very actively star-forming galaxies without AGN: most of the IR emission arises from new star formation
		- Contaminants:
			- AGN: AGN can also produce strong UV emission, often in dusty environments, and may contribute to IR emission by heating dust in the torus and clouds
			- Older stellar populations can also heat dust that is present in the ISM of a galaxy, contributing to the FIR emission
		- Total L_IR: an SED template of local galaxies to extrapolate from a single observed ﬂux density at some MIR or FIR wavelength, not necessarily close to the dust emission peak.
