# Cosmic Star-Formation History
Piero Madau and Mark Dickinson

- Tracers for star-formation
	- **UV-continuum emission**: the oldest galaxies is dominated by short-lived massive stars -> the oldest galaxies is dominated by short-lived massive stars
	- **rest-frame NIR**: near-solar-mass-evolved stars that make up the bulk of a galaxyâ€™s stellar mass-> the total global stellar mass density
	- **FIR emission of dusty starburst galaxies**:	Interstellar dust preferentially absorbs UV light and reradiates it in the thermal IR -> young stellar populations and the SFRD
